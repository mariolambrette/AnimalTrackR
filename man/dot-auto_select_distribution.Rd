\title{Automatically select the best-fitting distribution for a feature}
\usage{
.auto_select_distribution(values, feature_name = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{Numeric vector of feature values}

\item{feature_name}{Character. Name of the feature (used to detect angular
data based on naming conventions like "turning", "angle", "heading")}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{distribution}{Character string naming the selected distribution}
\item{params}{List of estimated distribution parameters}
\item{aic}{AIC value for the selected distribution (if fitted)}
\item{method}{How the distribution was selected ("fitted" or "default")}
}
\description{
Uses data properties and AIC comparison to select the most appropriate
distribution from those supported by hmmTMB. Handles angular data,
positive continuous data, and bounded (0, 1) data.
Feature name heuristics are used for angular detection. Returns distribution
name, estimated parameters, AIC, and method used for selection.
}
\details{
Supported distributions:
\itemize{
\item \code{norm}: Gaussian - for unbounded continuous data
\item \code{gamma}: Gamma - for positive, right-skewed data (e.g., speed)
\item \code{lnorm}: Log-normal - for positive, right-skewed data
\item \code{vm}: von Mises - for angular/circular data
(e.g., turning angle)
\item \code{beta}: Beta - for data bounded on (0, 1)
}
