\title{Standardise state labels (higher state = higher activity)}
\usage{
.standardise_state_labels(dets, features)
}
\arguments{
\item{dets}{Data frame with a \code{state} column containing integer state
assignments}

\item{features}{Character vector of feature names (used as fallback if
\code{speed} column is not present)}
}
\value{
Data frame with state column relabelled such that:
\itemize{
\item State 1 = lowest mean activity (e.g., resting)
\item State 2 = higher activity
\item State n = highest activity (for n_states > 2)
}
}
\description{
Reorders state labels so that higher state numbers correspond to higher
activity levels. Uses speed as the activity metric if available, otherwise
uses the first feature.
