\title{INTERNAL: Classify activity states using changepoint detection}
\usage{
.classify_changepoint(dets, method = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{dets}{Dataframe containing \code{activity_score}, \code{vid_id} columns}

\item{method}{Character. Changepoint detection method: "mean" (changes in
mean), "var" (changes in variance), or "meanvar" (changes in both mean
and variance). Default is "mean"}
}
\value{
Dataframe with added columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{state}: Integer state assignment based on segment means
relative to global median (1 = below median, 2 = above median)
\item \code{state_prob}: Set to NA (changepoint method provides no
probabilities)
}
Analysis is conducted separately for each video ID
}
\description{
Identifies behavioral state transitions by detecting changepoints in the
composite activity score using PELT algorithm. Can detect changes in mean,
variance, or both. States are assigned based on whether segment means are
above or below the global median activity score.
