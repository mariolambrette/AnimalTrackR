\title{INTERNAL: Classify activity states using Gaussian Mixture Model}
\usage{
.classify_gmm(dets, feature_cols, n_states)
}
\arguments{
\item{dets}{Dataframe containing detection data with normalized features}

\item{feature_cols}{Character vector of normalized feature column names
to use for GMM clustering}

\item{n_states}{Integer. Number of states (mixture components) to fit}
}
\value{
Dataframe with added columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{state}: Integer state assignment (1 to n_states)
\item \code{state_prob}: Probability of assigned state (maximum
posterior probability)
}
GMM model object is stored as attribute "gmm_model"
}
\description{
Fits a Gaussian Mixture Model to normalized movement features to identify
distinct behavioral states. Uses mclust package for model fitting and
returns state assignments with associated probabilities.
