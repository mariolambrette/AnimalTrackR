\title{INTERNAL: Calculate optimal threshold using Otsu's method}
\usage{
.otsu_threshold(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of values to threshold. NA values are removed
automatically}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar representing the optimal threshold value that
separates the data into two classes
}
\description{
Implements Otsu's thresholding algorithm to automatically determine the
optimal threshold that separates data into two classes by minimizing
within-class variance (equivalently, maximizing between-class variance).
Uses histogram-based approach for computational efficiency.
